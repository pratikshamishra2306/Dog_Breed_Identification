# Dog_Breed_Identification
This repository contains a deep learning project focused on identifying different dog breeds from images. The project uses convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image classification, leveraging popular framework, TensorFlow .

The codes would run much faster with the usage of a GPU which can be selected in runtime settings.
Due to limited usage of GPU in Google Colab, the codes took much longer to run.
The codes given should be run using a GPU preferably.
